\chapter{TCMB Mission Statement}\label{mission}

\textbf{Date}: Internet – 0033+1:20100224 (1266969017 UNIX time)

\textbf{From}: Telecomix Department of Defense, under the leadership of Cameron Wiener.

\textbf{To}: Telecomix Crypto Munitions Bureau (TCMB).

\textsc{Request for the deployment of a crypto munitions bureau.}

Recently, across almost all internets, intrusive legislation has been passed by states, corporate abuse has become more common, and the usage of encryption technologies has been questioned by authorities. Signals intelligence agencies are copying our traffic under the guise of what they deem to be a “threat to security”. However, with the improvements made to the networks and ever growing computer performance, we can consider plaintext communication to be a bug, an error inviting interception. This bug has to be worked around, for the safety of fellow netizens.

It has been said that only criminal elements are the ones hiding on the internet. It has been said that only criminals need to worry as they are the only ones that require private correspondence. This is not true. Privacy is fundamental to our lives.

In many countries there are laws that regulate how knowledge of cryptography is allowed to spread. From some locations it is even illegal to export cryptographic tools, forcing the developers to host their repositories overseas. These laws are residual products from the old cold war era, codified in the Wassenaar Arrangement, amongst many other texts.

The world has since changed considerably. Anyone with access to a computer can encrypt data to hide it from unauthorized peers. Cryptographic tools have become effortless means for anyone to use.

The TCMB will work according to the basic principles of the Internet. Its original design was nuclear proof; a distributed network built for the purpose of survival. Destroying one node in the network means that traffic is rerouted through other nodes. Today, however, we do not fear the ballistic missiles in the skies anymore. The cold war is over, but the threat to the information flows are still alive and real. In order for communications to survive without censorship or surveillance, computer networks have to be hardened to meet these new hazards.

There are soon 1 billion hosts on the internet. Each of these nodes can act as an encryption device capable of participating in anonymizing overlay networks, and protecting all of its traffic from unauthorized access. We can build a practically infinite number of internets inside the internets. There is nothing stopping us from creating fractal cipherspace, it is only a matter of generating bits and bytes that are encrypted and tunneled.

For internauts around the world there is an ever growing need for securing their data online. Regimes in Iran, China, the United Kingdom, France and Italy keep oppressing users to the extent that they risk their personal safety. What we need is a global network of tunnels that keep them safe. We have decided to work as tunnel diggers, fellow burrowers in cipherspace.

To pursue the overarching goal of creating a cipherspace within the internet as we know it, the Department of Defense declares that the Telecomix Crypto Munitions Bureau is inaugurated, and is given the following tasks:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Provide the engineering details needed to tranform desktop computers, embedded systems and powerful servers into nodes that make up the fabric of the cipherspace.
\item The construction of networks bridging to cipherspace and islands of high speed darknets where censorship can not exist.
\item The rise of the free digital infrastructure, in the form of blackthrows, long-range cantennas, wifi satellite dishes, and free anonymous data havens.
\item The generation and collection of tutorials and security wikis.
\item The further improvement of blackthrow technologies and their application within digital infrastructures.
\end{enumerate}

TCMB must meet both the goals of spreading knowledge and the demands for anonymity. The Bureau is commissioned to use the i2p-enabled IRC server telecomix.i2p. The Bureau will also produce philosophic knowledge in the WeRebuild Wiki.

Data matters! As an internaut, this is your life, your thoughts and your private information. The internauts should be in charge of it!

For freedom of thought to be preserved, the destruction of certain systems becomes a necessity. At other times these systems are to be designed and created ourselves. Some messages to be deciphered so as to allow the information contained for many to withdraw, others encrypted allowing the integrity between a few to withstand.

Language builds semantic bridges for understanding.

Linguistic errors dig syntactic tunnels of intimacy.

The TCMB is instructed to promote The Dark Sunday Celebration, as a time for reflection upon the life of the traffic that you produce, what do the bits you give birth to grow up into? Are they treated with integrity? What you can do to make their internet a nicer place? The knowledge of cipherspace is a knowledge for everyone!
